Survive of the falling from a big height in the Minecraft map, show your courage

This map is one of many MCPE maps of the "Dropper" series; you have 6 different tunnels (or holes) on this map to fall. Each MCPE tunnel is unique and you have to concentrate and collect all your hidden talents in one fist to do the first step and start falling, as a result of which you can both, come out victorious, flying all through the tunnel, and break yourself, not to be dodged in time. Most likely, the first attempt will not be very successful for you in the Minecraft game, but you will not stop, you will try it many times, again and again.

You will not regret it for a moment! The MCPE map task is very simple but it is complex at the same time. Drop down and try not to break!
